It's the laser pointer scene in the trailer so just watch it. Update: Maybe it's not in all versions of the trailer so I have to describe it. Denzel Washington points a laser pointer at a display and it comes out the other end ie. in view of the people under surveillance in the display. No, it's not the space time portal.

While I'm here, two other things worthy of note:
(1) it has best use of a sci-fi idea to motivate a car chase
(2) it has the absolute stupidest thing ever in a movie. It's the laser pointer scene in the trailer so just watch it.
Update: Maybe it's not in all versions of the trailer so I have to describe it. Denzel Washington points a laser pointer at a display and it comes out the other end ie. in view of the people under surveillance in the display. No, it's not the space time portal. It's one of many bordered windows tiled on a large screen.

What voters want or find appealing is straying into the territory of Hayek's information problem, but most of these discussions seem wildly over-optimistic and utopian regardless. The left in western democracies (if such a concept is meaningful) should spend far more time with our long list of failures, more time asking why we lose. I am adamantly in favour of a world of red plenty, but there is no path to it without such strategic thought.
