My talk at @hopeconf is viewable online at roughly the 6:25:00 mark: https://livestream.com/internetsociety3/hope2024/videos/247995934
I'd gotten lots of questions after the talk, which I'm very happy about. This is probably the most engaging talk that I've ever given by that metric.
I didn't get to answer some of the questions that I'd said I'd answer offline, but feel free to get in touch with me if you're reading this and want to know more (I know a couple of attendees followed me and some of you are probably reading this).
And as always, corrections about technical inaccuracies are always welcome. I'll be following up with posts of references to some of the papers, etc, that I'd mentioned.

It was interesting to see the variety of submissions. Notable ones included:
* performing a hypothesis test for cooperativeness every iteration (unfortunate for my machine because it was 𝑂(1))
* Two strategies which attempted to detect each other and sacrifice one for the benefit of the other (technically not allowed under the rules of the prisoner's dilemma, but it was funny to see an anomalous result in the playoff matrix)
Overall, it was a fun contest!

Grief counseling:
   Existing grief counseling techniques need to be adapted for the unique context of space colonies. Counselors need to help people process grief while also embracing the concept of physical recycling.
Positive aspects of recycling: The idea that one's body will continue to contribute to the colony's survival could indeed be comforting. It provides a tangible form of continuation and purpose after death. This could be framed as a final act of service to the community, which might be particularly meaningful in the close-knit environment of a space colony.
Embalming and viewing:
     a) A short-term cooling system for brief viewings
     b) Virtual reality recreations for "viewing" without preserving the physical body
     c) Symbolic representations, like a hologram or photo display, during the ceremony
Cultural shift:
   Over time, colonists might develop new traditions that don't involve viewing the body at all, focusing instead on celebrating the person's life and their final contribution to the colony.
Educational component:
   Understanding the recycling process and its importance to the colony's survival could be part of the colony's general education, 
Personalization:
   Allow individuals to specify how they'd like their elements to be used (e.g., for agriculture, for building materials, etc.)
(That last one had not occurred to me but OK)
