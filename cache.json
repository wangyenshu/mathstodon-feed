          "description": "One last bit of C++ for today.\nYou can think of a vector field as describing a flow on a manifold and allowing the flow to happen for time t gives you a diffeomorphism of the manifold ie. a differentiable invertible map from the manifold to itself. The textbooks often use these diffeomeorphisms to reason about the vector fields, but going from vector field to diffeomorphism can require a non-trivial integration.\nBut if you have an infinitesimal Œµ it's trivial to make a diffeomorphism in a setup where the manifold is embedded in a larger ambient space where the tangent vectors are literally tangent to the manifold. You can just map x to x + Œµv(x).\nFor example, if f and g are the diffeomorphisms arising from a pair of vector fields we can compute their Lie bracket (equivalently the Lie derivative of one wrt the other) by studying f(g(x))-g(f(x)). Which makes it easy to compute Lie brackets using dual numbers in your favourite programming language. Here's a C++ example of computing the Lie bracket of a pair of fields considered to be vector fields tangent to the unit sphere.\n- Dan Piponi (@dpiponi) July 11, 2024",

Some classic studies on this show humans over-estimate our ability to understand how toilets, zippers and bows and arrows function at a basic level.\nI think about this as a structuring phenomena of almost all folk theories of social science or politics. People are thoroughly convinced, as this week has shown, that they understand things like the causes, symptoms and cures to the dangerous rise of far right, they think they understand how to better run a political campaign, and they think their preferred policies, if given the chance, would easily attract voters. What voters want or find appealing is straying into the territory of Hayek's information problem, but most of these discussions seem wildly over-optimistic and utopian regardless. The left in western democracies (if such a concept is meaningful) should spend far more time with our long list of failures, more time asking why we lose. I am adamantly in favour of a world of red plenty, but there is no path to it without such strategic thought.\n- Boarders (@boarders) June 30, 2024",
