Some classic studies on this show humans over-estimate our ability to understand how toilets, zippers and bows and arrows function at a basic level.\nI think about this as a structuring phenomena of almost all folk theories of social science or politics. People are thoroughly convinced, as this week has shown, that they understand things like the causes, symptoms and cures to the dangerous rise of far right, they think they understand how to better run a political campaign, and they think their preferred policies, if given the chance, would easily attract voters. What voters want or find appealing is straying into the territory of Hayek's information problem, but most of these discussions seem wildly over-optimistic and utopian regardless. The left in western democracies (if such a concept is meaningful) should spend far more time with our long list of failures, more time asking why we lose.
