          "description": "One last bit of C++ for today.\nYou can think of a vector field as describing a flow on a manifold and allowing the flow to happen for time t gives you a diffeomorphism of the manifold ie. a differentiable invertible map from the manifold to itself. The textbooks often use these diffeomeorphisms to reason about the vector fields, but going from vector field to diffeomorphism can require a non-trivial integration.\nBut if you have an infinitesimal ε it's trivial to make a diffeomorphism in a setup where the manifold is embedded in a larger ambient space where the tangent vectors are literally tangent to the manifold. You can just map x to x + εv(x).\nFor example, if f and g are the diffeomorphisms arising from a pair of vector fields we can compute their Lie bracket (equivalently the Lie derivative of one wrt the other) by studying f(g(x))-g(f(x)). Which makes it easy to compute Lie brackets using dual numbers in your favourite programming language. Here's a C++ example of computing the Lie bracket of a pair of fields considered to be vector fields tangent to the unit sphere.\n- Dan Piponi (@dpiponi) July 11, 2024",
